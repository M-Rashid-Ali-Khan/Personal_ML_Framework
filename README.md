# Personal_ML_Framework
Trying to make my own personal ML Framework to better understand the magical behind the scenes of an ML/DL framework. It is a Google Collab notebook and I tried to make it in 2022. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete it as I had not developed enough undersrtanding of the math included. I am uploading to share it with everyone.
